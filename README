					            LINPHONE ON IPHONE
					******************************************

					
BUILD PREQUISITES
*****************

Linphone for iPhone depends on liblinphone sdk. This SDK is generated from makefiles and shell scripts.
You must first install both xcode with iPhone OS SDK and MacPorts (www.macports.org) for these scripts to work.

Make sure that /opt/local/bin (macport tools) arrives first in your PATH env variable, so that the macport tools are taken in place of the versions brought by Apple in /usr/bin. Otherwise the build will fail with obscure errors.

Once xcode and macports are installed, open a terminal and install the required build-time tools with:

	$ sudo port install coreutils automake autoconf libtool intltool wget pkgconfig cmake gmake yasm grep doxygen ImageMagick optipng


Install gas-preprosessor.pl  (http://github.com/yuvi/gas-preprocessor/ ) to be copied into /opt/local/bin :

	$ wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.github.com/yuvi/gas-preprocessor/master/gas-preprocessor.pl
	$ sudo mv gas-preprocessor.pl /opt/local/bin/.
	$ sudo chmod +x /opt/local/bin/gas-preprocessor.pl

Link macport libtoolize to glibtoolize 

	$ sudo ln -s /opt/local/bin/glibtoolize /opt/local/bin/libtoolize

Link host's strings to simulator SDK 

	For Xcode prior to 4.3:
	$ sudo ln -s  /usr/bin/strings /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/usr/bin/strings
	For newer XCode:
	$ sudo ln -s  /usr/bin/strings /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/usr/bin/strings


BUILDING THE SDK
****************

 * GPL third parties versus non GPL third parties

 This sdk can be generated in 2 flavors. Firt is with GPL third parties, it means liblinphone includes GPL third parties like FFMPEG or x264. 
 If you choose this flavor, your final application must comply with GPL in any case. This is the default mode.

 To generate the liblinphone multi arch sdk in GPL mode, do:
	$ cd submodules/build
	$ make all 

 ALTERNATIVELY, you can force liblinphone to use only non GPL code except for liblinphone, mediastremer2, ortp, exosip, osip.
 If you choose this flavor, your final application  is still subject to GPL except if you have a commercial license for liblinphone, mediastremer2, ortp, exosip, osip.

 To generate the liblinphone multi arch sdkin non GPL mode, do:
	$ cd submodules/build
	$ make all enable_gpl_third_parties=no

xcode prior to 4.5:
	$ make -f Makefile.xcode4.4
 * ZRTP support

 You can enable ZRTP support in GPL mode only, by adding "enable_zrtp=yes" to the make command, for example:
 	$ make all enable_gpl_third_parties=yes enable_zrtp=yes
	

The resulting sdk is in liblinphone-sdk/ directory.


In case you upgrade your IOS SDK, you may force rebuilding everything, by doing
	$ make veryclean
	$ make all

BUILDING THE APPLICATION
************************

After the SDK is built, just open the linphone xcode project with Xcode, and press "Run".

 * Note regarding third party components subject to license
 
The liblinphone-sdk is compiled with third parties code that are subject to patent license, specially: AMR, SILK G729 and  X264 codecs.
Linphone controls the embedding of these codecs thanks to the preprocessor macros HAVE_SILK, HAVE_AMR, HAVE_G729 HAVE_X264 positioned in xcode project.
Before embeding these 4 codecs in the final application, make sure to have the right to do so.

TRANSLATER THE APPLICATION
**************************

You have to download the application Localization Suite(http://www.loc-suite.org/)
Each modification in a xib have to be scanned and synchronized


LIMITATIONS, KNOWN BUGS
***********************

* Video capture does not work in simulator (not implemented by simulator ?).
* Sound does not work well (or at all) in simulator

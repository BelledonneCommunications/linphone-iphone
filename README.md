# How can I contribute?

Thanks for asking! We love pull requests from everyone. Depending on what you want to do, you can help us improve Linphone in
various ways:

## Help on translations

We no longer use transifex for the translation process, instead we have deployed our own instance of [Weblate](https://weblate.linphone.org/projects/linphone-iphone/).

Due to the full app rewrite we can't re-use previous translations, so we'll be very happy if you want to contribute.

## Report bugs and submit patchs

If you want to dig through Linphone code or report a bug, please read `CONTRIBUTING.md` first. You should also read this `README` entirely ;-).

## How to be a beta tester ?

Enter the Beta :
- Download TestFlight from the App Store and log in it with your apple-id
-Tap the public link on your iOS device. The public link : https://testflight.apple.com/join/LUlmZWjH
-Touch View in TestFlight or Start Testing. You can also touch Accept, Install, or Update for Linphone app.
-And voilà ! You can update your beta version with the same public link when a new one is available

Send a crash report :
 - It is done automatically by TestFlight

Report a bug :
 - Open Linphone
 - Go to Settings —> Advanced —> Send logs
 - An email to linphone-iphone@belledonne-communications.com is created with your logs attached
 - Fill in the bug description with :
	* What you were doing
	* What happened
	* What you were expecting
	* Approximately when the bug happened
 - Change the object to [Beta test - Bug report]

# Building the application

## What's new

Now the default way of building linphone-iphone is to use CocoaPods to retrieve the linphone-sdk frameworks.
Compared to previous versions, this project no longer uses submodules developper has to build in order to get a working app.
However, if you wish to use a locally compiled SDK, read paragraph "Using a local linphone SDK" below to know how to proceed.

## Building the app

If you don't have CocoaPods already, you can download and install it using :
```
	sudo gem install cocoapods
```
**If you alreadly have Cocoapods, make sur that the version is higher than 1.7.5**.

- Install the app's dependencies with cocoapods first:
```
	pod install
```
  It will download the linphone-sdk from our gitlab repository so you don't have to build anything yourself.
- Then open `linphone.xcworkspace` file (**NOT linphone.xcodeproj**) with XCode to build and run the app.

# Limitations and known bugs

* Video capture will not work in simulator (not implemented in it).


# Using a local linphone SDK

- Clone the linphone-sdk repository from out gitlab:
```
   git clone https://gitlab.linphone.org/BC/public/linphone-sdk.git --recursive
```

- Follow the instructions in the linphone-sdk/README file to build the SDK.

- Rebuild the project:
```
   PODFILE_PATH=<path to linphone-sdk-ios> pod install
```
  where <path to linphone-sdk-ios> is your build directory of the linphone-sdk project, containing the `linphone-sdk.podspec` file and a `linphone-sdk` ouptut directory comprising built frameworks and resources.

- Then open linphone.xcworkspace with Xcode to build and run the app.

# Enabling crashlytics

We've integrated Crashlytics into liphone-iphone, which can automatically send crash reports. It is disabled by default.
To activate it:

- Replace the GoogleService-Info.plist for this project with yours (specific to your crashlytics account).

- Rebuild the project:
```
    USE_CRASHLYTICS=true pod install
```

- Then open `linphone.xcworkspace` with Xcode to build and run the app.

# Quick UI reference

- The app is contained in a window, which resides in the MainStoryboard file.
- The delegate is set to LinphoneAppDelegate in main.m, in the UIApplicationMain() by passing its class
- Basic layout:

        MainStoryboard
                |
                | (rootViewController)
                |
            PhoneMainView ---> view |--> app background
                |                   |
                |                   |--> statusbar background
                |
                | (mainViewController)
                |
            UICompositeView : TPMultilayout
                        |
                        |---> view  |--> statusBar
                                    |
                                    |--> contentView
                                    |
                                    |--> tabBar


When the application is started, the phoneMainView gets asked to transition to the Dialer view or the Assistant view.
PhoneMainView exposes the -changeCurrentView: method, which will setup its
Any Linphone view is actually presented in the UICompositeView, with or without a statusBar and tabBar.

The UICompositeView consists of 3 areas laid out vertically. From top to bottom: StatusBar, Content and TabBar.
The TabBar is usually the UIMainBar, which is used as a navigation controller: clicking on each of the buttons will trigger
a transition to another "view".

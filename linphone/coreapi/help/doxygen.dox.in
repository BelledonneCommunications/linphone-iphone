 * The application can initiate outgoing calls with linphone_core_invite().
 * It is notified of incoming call thanks to the inv_recv callback of the LinphoneCoreVTable
 * structure that is passed at creation of the LinphoneCore object.
 * It can then answer calls with linphone_core_accept_call().
 * Calls can be terminated or declined with linphone_core_terminate_call().
 * The application is notified when the remote party hangups thanks to 
 * bye_recv callback of the #LinphoneCoreVTable.
